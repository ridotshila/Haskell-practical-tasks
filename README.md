# Haskell Practical Tasks â€“ Chapters 1 to 12

This repository contains solved Haskell practical tasks based on chapters 1 through 12 of a functional programming course. Each chapter introduces foundational Haskell concepts through hands-on coding exercises.

## ðŸ“š Covered Topics

- Chapter 1â€“2: Functions, types, and expressions  
- Chapter 3â€“4: Conditionals, guards, pattern matching  
- Chapter 5â€“6: Higher-order functions, recursion, folds  
- Chapter 7â€“8: Type classes and custom data types  
- Chapter 9â€“10: Parametric and recursive types, instances  
- Chapter 11â€“12: Basic IO and first Haskell programs

## ðŸ›  How to Run

```bash
ghc Main.hs -o HaskellTasks
./HaskellTasks
```

Youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a task by number (1â€“10) for each chapter.

ðŸ“‚ File Structure
- Main.hs â€“ All task implementations with interactive main

- Organized by chapter and task comments

- Uses standard Haskell libraries (no external dependencies)

âœ… Requirements
- GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)

- Terminal or IDE that supports Haskell (e.g. VS Code with Haskell extension)
